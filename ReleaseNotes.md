## Mabot 0.7 ##

This version is mainly compatibility release and makes Mabot compatible with Robot Framework 2.5. Unfortunately it was not possible to maintain support for older Robot Framework versions and therefore 0.7 works
only with RF 2.5. If RF 2.1.3 or older is needed, Mabot 0.6.1 needs to be used.
